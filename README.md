# Agent-Based-Modeling
A set of modified Vicsek models and binary models for studying modes of information flow. The code provided was used to generate the data used to analyze modes of information flow in [1] Sattari et al., Science Advances 2021. 

modified_VM.m provides the two-agent Vicsek models which allow for turning on and off the memory of followers and/or leaders

modified_VM_multi.m provides the multi-agent Vicsek models which allow for varying the number of leaders and turning on or off follower-to-follower interaction

binary_models.m provides the binary two-agent cases explained in the Supplementary Materials of [1]

binary_models_multi.m provides the binary multi-agent cases explained in the Supplementary Materials of [1]
